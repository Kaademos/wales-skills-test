# Challenge: Where in the World?

**Your Mission:**
You have been given one or more image files, each containing subtle clues about a secret location. Your task is to analyze the provided image(s) and determine exactly where it was taken.

**Instructions:**
1. You will receive up to four images. Each image represents a unique location

   *(Note:You must rely on metadata extraction to confirm their identity.If you see a structure or a landscape that looks somewhat familiar, don't guess---use the coordinates to be certain.)*

2. Examine the image's metadata for any hidden GPS coordinates. Tools like `exiftool` or `https://jimpl.com/`are recommended.

3.  Once you have the coordinates, plug them into an online mapping service (e.g., Google Maps) and identify the exact location.

4.  Submit the name of the location and the coordinates, and (optionally) a brief explanation of how you found it.

**Note for Organizers:**

-   You may choose to provide participants with only one image from the set or all four at once.
-   Each image should have its corresponding GPS metadata embedded.
-   Feel free to mix and match which images you share with participants.

**Submission:**

-   Depending on the competition rules, participants can submit their answer which includes the image number or name, the discovered location name, and coordinates.

Good luck!
